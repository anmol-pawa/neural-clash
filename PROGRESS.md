# Neural Clash progress

Append a dated entry after every run: what changed, how it was verified (commands, screenshot notes), known gaps, what's next. Newest at the bottom.

## 2026-10-28: Project seeded
- Added `CLAUDE.md`, `ROADMAP.md` (phases A–I), `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md`, `docs/CURRICULUM.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Interview-format research checked 2026-10-28:
  - Meta's AI-enabled round (since Oct 2025) uses a multi-file codebase with phases bug fix → implement → optimise, scored on problem solving, code quality, verification and communication.
  - Google is piloting AI-assisted code-comprehension rounds.
  - Applied-AI loops emphasise RAG, evals (LLM-as-judge calibration and biases), agent debugging and system design around models you don't control.
- The C++ judge should be ported from Algo Clash once it exists (`@yowasp/clang` ships libc++ for wasm32-wasip1).
- Next: ROADMAP A1.
